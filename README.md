# python-algorithms

-- I developed my skill in programming and problem solving in python through:
* taking MIT 6.001 
* reading [Python Documentation] (https://docs.python.org/3/)
* and [Stackoverflow] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python)
<br> IDE: [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) *simple and robust platform*


-- This repo includes Algorithms OR Pseudocodes: 
  1. Linked-list printing
  2. Cube Root Guess
  3. Decimal -> binary converting 
  4. Float -> binary converting
  5. Square root finding
  6. Square root by using *bisection algorithm*
  7. Guessing a number GAME
  8. Newton-Raphson Way of finding square root
  9. Finding Root - pth root of n 

A quote from Nikola Tesla: 

*The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane.*
